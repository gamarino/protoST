# Changelog

All notable changes to protoST are recorded here. The living, item-by-item
state of the language is tracked in [`docs/STATUS.md`](docs/STATUS.md).

## 0.1.0 — Initial release (2026-05-22)

The first public release of **protoST** — an actor-native Smalltalk runtime
built on the [protoCore](../protoCore) kernel.

### Language

- Lexer, parser and a non-recursive bytecode VM; closures with capture;
  classes, instances, methods and instance variables; `self` / `super`.
- Non-local return and the full Smalltalk exception protocol
  (`on:do:`, `signal`, `ensure:`, `ifCurtailed:`, resumable / retry).
- A real collection hierarchy and the iteration protocol.
- A standard library (Stream, Math, Random, JSON, Time) and a file-based
  module system integrated with protoCore's UMD module discovery.
- Advanced object model — multiple inheritance, mixins (`uses:`), runtime
  behaviour composition (`addBehavior:`).

### Actors and concurrency

- A first-class, language-embedded actor model: `asActor`, asynchronous
  message sends returning `Future`s, one-message-at-a-time per actor, a
  parallel worker-pool scheduler, and cooperative yield/resume.
- **Lock-free actor mailbox and Future** — no per-actor or per-future mutex;
  both run on protoCore's atomic attribute compare-and-swap.
- **`Atom`** — a shared mutable cell with optimistic-concurrency CAS
  (`value:ifCurrent:`, `swap:`), plus `Object>>setInstVar:from:to:` — the raw
  CAS on any instance variable.

### Tooling

- An interactive REPL, a Debug Adapter Protocol debugger (VS Code), native
  installers (CPack), a dual-audience tutorial, ~40 runnable examples and a
  benchmark suite.

### Tests

- 751 tests pass via `ctest` (the conformance suite, the unit suite, the
  examples and the CLI stress tests), each run in its own process.

### Known issues

Recorded honestly, with bounds, in [`KNOWN_ISSUES.md`](KNOWN_ISSUES.md):
one `STRuntime` per process (K1), very large ropes (K2), no `%` string
formatting (K3). None affects the shipped CLI configuration.
